->(08/12):
    -Understood Gesture Recognition Model and training
    -Ensured client-server connection is established between laptop and rpi

->(08/13):
    -Worked on Repo and Structure
    -Acquired token for PI (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-->paste in password)

->(08/14):
    -Able to control motors through trigger from client
    -Able ot control motors through keyboard
    -Realized that I will need to uninstall the tensorflow lib and only leave the tensorflow-cpu lib when training the model with new gestures 
     then adding the tensorflow lib when running 'app.py'
